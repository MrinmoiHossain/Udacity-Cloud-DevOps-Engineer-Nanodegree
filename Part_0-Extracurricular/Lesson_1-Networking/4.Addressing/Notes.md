* The pink squares (0, 10, and 127) are blocks that are entirely reserved.
* The blue squares are blocks that are partially reserved. For instance, not all of the 192 block is reserved, but some of it is.
* The entire green row (starting at 224) is set aside for IP multicast.
* And the entire orange bottom row (starting at 240) was originally set aside for "future use" but was effectively lost due to being blocked as invalid.
